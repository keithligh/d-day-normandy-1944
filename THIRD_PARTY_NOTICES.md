## 2. Map data: fetched at setup, NOT redistributed in this repository

The terrain and imagery tiles are **not** committed to this repository (see
`.gitignore`). They are downloaded from their source providers by
`tools/fetch_tiles.mjs` and displayed at runtime. The required attributions are
shown persistently in the app UI and reproduced here:
